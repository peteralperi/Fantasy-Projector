# Fantasy-Projector

About Pete's Projector:
Pete's Projector is a project that takes in an NFL player from the user and returns a projected fantasy football score for that player, based on the player's opponent and performance in the previous three weeks of play. The project uses Flask and pythonanywhere to deploy the user interface. The link to the website can be found [here](https://peteralperi15.pythonanywhere.com). To use the projector, all you have to do is type in the players name (First Last with correct capitalization), and the score will be outputted below the textbox!
